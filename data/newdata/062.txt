Fans tell us why they won't stop fighting to 'RestoreTheSnyderVerse' even though there's no plan for 'Zack Snyder's Justice League' sequels
Will Rowlands was tuned into Zack Snyder's "Man of Steel" watch party last May, wondering if the director was finally going to announce what he and other fans had waited years to hear. After rallying since late 2017 for Warner Bros. to release the "Snyder cut," Rowlands, an actor and longtime supporter of the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut campaign, watched on Vero with other fans as Snyder revealed a poster for "Zack Snyder's Justice League." Snyder and his producing partner and wife, Deborah Snyder, previously stepped down from the theatrical cut in 2017 following their daughter's death and a studio mandate to keep the superhero film to two hours. As a result, controversial director Joss Whedon ("The Avengers") took over, rewriting and heavily reshooting the film. Now, Snyder was finally going to see his original vision for the film through â€” something unheard of in Hollywood. Zack Snyder showed the above image to fans to announce his cut of the film was coming to HBO Max. HBO Max "It was a surreal moment," Rowlands told Insider. "It's like, you've won the battle." "But something inside me was thinking, what if they screw him again?" he added. Fast-forward nearly a year later, leading up to the release of "Zack Snyder's Justice League" was a bit of a disaster. Part of the film strangely leaked on HBO Max 10 days early when some users started streaming "Tom and Jerry." The mistake was fixed the same day. On March 15, the night of the film's virtual premiere, technical difficulties delayed screening links to fans and media for nearly six hours.  justice league premiere emails  These were the only three email correspondences Insider received the night of the virtual premiere. Kirsten Acuna/Insider More than four hours after the film's virtual premiere was set to begin, there was still no solution. Snyder tweeted out a simple, "I have no words. Still waiting for info. So sorry." Screening links were finally accompanied with a note saying in part, "we want to express our sincerest apologies for any inconvenience caused by this delay." The #ReleaseTheSnyderCut campaign, in theory, was supposed to die out after the film's release on March 18. The opposite happened. Snyder was allowed to end the film on a cliff-hanger with a villain preparing to invade Earth. (The film was always intended to go on for another two movies). In doing so, it opened the door for fans to ask for a sequel. Still, before too many fans could start demanding a sequel, WarnerMedia Studios CEO Ann Sarnoff told Variety none were happening despite their parent company, AT&T, putting storyboards for sequels on display in an official exhibit in Texas. Variety added that the studio wants to "move past the social media campaign." That hasn't sat well with fans. Though the company may believe it satisfied the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement by releasing the long-fabled "Snyder cut," it's unclear how anyone could watch the four-hour movie and think fans would be placated. Now, a movement WarnerMedia thought it could move past is evolving, growing, and shows no signs of slowing down until they either get the sequels they want or Snyder tells fans that he's moving on. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut quickly became #RestoreTheSnyderVerse zack snyders justice league The movement name changed quickly leading up to the film's release.
